If you are banned due to violation of our player rules, you will not get a refund. If you do not favor the service, you will not get a refund. If you unexpectedly did not receive your certificate, and don't have any proof of your purchase, you will not get a refund. You may appeal your case regarding your purchase on the forums by PM to a member of Management, and we will review your case, but we do not guarantee that you will receive any additional {copyright} VIP Club awards other than a certificate of membership and recognition on the web site's forum, as defined above. It's not required for you to make a purchase or join the club to enjoy the full experience of {copyright}; it's completely optional and is done at your own risk. </p>
